  on paper
  by <strong>Jacqueline Woodson</strong>

  The first time I write my full name

  Jacqueline Amanda Woodson

  without anybody's help
  on a clean white page in my composition notebook,
  I know

  if I wanted to

  I could write anything.

  <em>Letters becoming words, words gathering meaning,
    becoming
    thoughts outside my head</em>

  becoming sentences
